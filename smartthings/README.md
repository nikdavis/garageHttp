### Files for integration with SmartThings hub
These files are to be used with the SmartThings hub. They handle device setup. The service manager manages the lifecycle of connecting over the LAN to the garageDoor server. The device handler is actually the application that you use to control the garage door (e.g. push buttons on your phone and send REST requests from the hub).
